</h1><h3 class="author">by Percy Bysshe Shelley
</h3><p>I met a traveller from an antique land<br>Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br>Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,<br>Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br>And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br>Tell that its sculptor well those passions read,<br>Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br>The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed,<br>And on the pedestal these words appear:<br>"My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings:<br>Look upon my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"<br>Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br>Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare<br>The lone and level sands stretch far away.</p><br></body></html>
