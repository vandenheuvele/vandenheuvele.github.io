</h3><p>'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
<br>did gyre and gimble in the wabe.<br>All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>And the mome raths outgrabe.
</p><p>"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!<br>The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br>Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br>the frumious Bandersnatch!"
</p><p>He took his vorpal sword in hand:
<br>Long time the maxome foe he sought-
<br>So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
<br>And stood a while in thought.
</p><p>As in uffish thought he stood,
<br>The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
<br>Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
<br>And burbled as it came.
</p><p>One, two! One, two! And through and through<br>The vorpal blade went snicker-snack.<br>He left it dead, and with its head<br>He went galumphing back.
</p><p>"Has thou slain the Jabberwock?<br>Come to my arms, my beamish boy!<br>O frabjous day! Calloh! Callay!
<br>He chortled in his joy.
</p><p>'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
<br>Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br>All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>And the mome raths outgrabe.</p></body></html>
